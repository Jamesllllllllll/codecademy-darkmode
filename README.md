Currently the majority of the CSS modifies the colours and not much more.

The CSS uses variables for ease of use and future extensibility (ie. colours could be changed on-the-fly, only needing to change the variables.

See the variables in the `:root` element.

- [ ] Add more themes
- [ ] Create a popup when the browser extension icon is clicked to choose a theme
